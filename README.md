This repository contains the companion code for the paper **"Turning Multiple Key-Dependent Attacks into Universal Attacks"** by ***

## Overview

Key-dependent attacks are effective only for specific weak-key classes, limiting their practical impact. This work presents a statistical framework that combines multiple key-dependent distinguishers into universal attacks covering the full key space.

Applied to **Orthros-PRF**, a sum-of-permutations design where differential-based distinguishers hold only for a fraction of keys, this yields the **first universal 8-round differential-linear key-recovery attack** with median time complexity 2^119.58, whereas prior work reached at most 7 rounds in the weak-key setting.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Generic Framework for Universal Attacks

We propose a generic framework for combining multiple key-dependent attacks into a universal attack. The framework tests the secret key against multiple weak-key distinguishers using log-likelihood ratio statistics and aggregates the results to reduce effective key entropy across the full key space.

### 2. First Universal 8-Round Attack on Orthros-PRF

We apply our framework to Orthros-PRF and obtain the first universal 8-round differential-linear key-recovery attack with median time complexity 2^119.58, whereas prior work reached at most 7 rounds in the weak-key setting. The attack complexity varies across the key space: median complexity is 2^119.58 (for at least 50% of keys), while worst-case complexity is 2^126.92 (for approximately 48% of keys that are strong against all employed distinguishers).

### 3. Automated Attack Discovery with MILP

We develop a CP-MILP model for automated discovery of complete differential-linear attacks that integrates distinguisher search with key recovery. We extend the open-source [S-box Analyzer](https://github.com/hadipourh/sboxanalyzer) to support deterministic propagation of differences and linear masks, and discover multidimensional distinguishers covering up to 10 rounds in each Orthros branch, **improving the prior best by 4 rounds**.

### 4. Open-Source Implementation and Experimental Validation

We provide open-source implementations of our attack discovery tools and statistical framework, allowing independent verification and supporting future work on other primitives. Experimental observations that motivate and validate our statistical modeling are included in the paper.

- C++17 compiler (GCC 7+ or Clang 10+)

### Example Workflow

1. **Discover distinguishers** using CP/MILP-based search:

   ```bash
   cd attack
   # Example: 6-round PRF distinguisher (Distinguisher 0 from paper)
   python3 attackprf.py -offset 2 -RB 1 -RU 1 -RM 4 -RL 0 -d 10
   ```
2. **Verify distinguisher correlations** on GPU:

   ```bash
   cd verification/distinguisher
   ./build.sh
   # Example: 5-round PRF Distinguisher 0 from paper
   ./build/cuda_dlct -r 5 -o 3 -m 2 \
     --diff-left 00002020000000000000000000000000 \
     --diff-right 00000000000044000000000000000000 \

   cd verification/keyrecovery/llr
   make
   # Run Monte Carlo simulation over 10,000 keys for 5-round distinguishers
   ./main histogram-5r
   ```
